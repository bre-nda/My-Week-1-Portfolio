        i found programming interesting and decided to study it, and that's when i decided to join Moringa School.</p>
    <p>I decided to join Moringa because it's the best institution to learn coding.<br>Another reason why chose I Moringa,is after i an alumni adviced to learn coding from there. </p>

    <h2>My Educational Background</h2>
    <p>Most people say programming is difficult but I can say it's not.<br>Actually I have always been a bright student starting from Primary,where i schooled at Peak Academy and got 383 marks.<br>I later joined Bunyore Girl's Highschool, a national school
        my national exams i got a mean grade of B+.<br>I then got an admission to join the University of Nairobi to study a BSc in Statistics.<br>In the university is where I got introduced to programming.</p>

    <p>Currently am at Moringa School.I am enjoying learnig programming because it's my passion plus it's a good course because everyday i learn new things ,which makes it interesting to study .</p>
    <p>Learning programming has made me acquire new skills.The skills are;
