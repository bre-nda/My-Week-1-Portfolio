    <p>A Web Developer</p>

    <p>My name is Brenda Andeso.I am a Softare Developer majoring on Web Development.I got into programming after i was introduced abit of it back in the university.After that introduction, i found programming interesting and decided to study it, and that's
        when i decided to join Moringa School.</p>
    <p>I decided to join Moringa because it's the best institution to learn coding.Another reason why chose I Moringa,is after i an alumni adviced to learn coding from there. </p>
    <p>Most people say programming is difficult but I can it's not.Actually I have always been a bright student starting from Primary,where i schooled at Peak Academy and got 383 marks.I later joined Bunyore Girl's Highschool, a national school where in
        my national exams i got a mean grade of B+.I then got an admission to join the University of Nairobi to study a BSc in Statistics.In the university is where I got introduced to programming.</p>
    <p>After graduating from Moringa School,I started working officially as a web developer.</p>
