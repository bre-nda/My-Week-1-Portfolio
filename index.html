    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Brenda Andeso and I am 20 years old.I am currently a Softare Developer student majoring on Web Development at Moringa school.<br>I got into programming after I was introduced abit of it back in the university.<br>After that introduction,
        I found programming interesting and decided to study it, and that's when I decided to join Moringa School.</p>
    <p>I decided to join Moringa because it's the best institution to learn coding.<br>Another reason why I chose Moringa,is after an alumni adviced to learn coding from there. </p>

    <h2>My Educational Background</h2>
    <p>Most people say programming is difficult but I can say it's not.<br>Actually I have always been a bright student starting from Primary,where I schooled at <strong>Peak Academy</strong> and got <strong>383 marks</strong>.<br>I later joined <strong>Bunyore Girl's Highschool</strong>,<strong> a national school </strong>and
        got a mean grade of <strong>B+.</strong><br>I got admitted at the University of Nairobi to pursue a BSc in Statistics and there is where I got introduced to programming.

        <p>Currently am at Moringa School.I am enjoying learnig programming because it's my passion plus it's a good course because everyday I learn new things ,which makes it interesting to study .</p>
        <p>Learning programming has made me acquire new skills.The skills are;
            <div class="skills">
                <ul>
                    <li>Using HTML</li>
                    <li>Using CSS</li>
                    <li>Using JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>The skills are usefull because now I can code,something which I have always wanted to do though am still learnig.</p>
